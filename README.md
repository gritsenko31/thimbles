### Controls

- **Place Bet** - Select bet amount before round starts
- **Start Button** - Begin shuffling
- **New Game** - Reset and start over

### Game Rules
- Ball is placed under one of three cups
- Cups shuffle rapidly for several seconds
- Keep your eyes on the cup with the ball
- Click the correct cup after shuffling stops
- Correct guess = win (2x your bet or point)
- Wrong guess = lose bet/streak
- Difficulty increases with each successful round

### Difficulty Levels

- **Medium** - Moderate speed, 8-12 moves
- **Hard** - Fast shuffles, 12-15 moves
- **Expert** - Very fast, 15+ complex moves

## 🧠 Tips & Strategies

- **Focus on one cup** - Don't try to watch all three
- **Track the pattern** - Shuffles often follow sequences
- **Watch cup handles** - If visible, use as reference points
- **Stay centered** - Position yourself to see all cups clearly
- **Practice peripheral vision** - Helps track fast movements
- **Take breaks** - Attention fatigue affects performance

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### Shuffle Patterns
- Simple swaps (2 cups exchange positions)
- Circular rotations (3 cups rotate)
- Cross-overs (diagonal swaps)
- Speed variations (slow to fast)
- Fake movements (cups lift but don't swap)

### Scoring
- Each correct guess increases your streak
- Higher streaks = faster shuffles
- Wrong guess resets streak to 0
- Best streak is saved locally
